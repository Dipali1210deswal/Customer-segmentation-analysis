# Customer Segmentation Analysis

In today's data-driven landscape, companies leverage data analysis to make strategic decisions, enhance customer experience, and boost profits. This involves employing data mining techniques and machine learning algorithms to uncover valuable insights. A key application is customer segmentation, which is widely used across industries. For instance, Netflix utilizes it for recommendations, while banks use it for fraud detection and risk assessment. In the retail industry, specifically in a mall setting, customer segmentation helps identify and target potential customer groups, enabling businesses to tailor products and services to meet specific customer needs.

## Current System

In the existing system the analysis and segmentation of the customers was done by visualizing the graphs by clustering the two or more features . Using the basic graphs analysis can be done up to some data. 
There are some disadvantages of the current system i.e.

•	Data Points are overlapped

•	The data does not hold some patterns

•	Data clusters were inappropriate for accurate considerations.

## Tools and Framework 

• Python: The primary programming language for this project.

• Jupyter Notebook: For interactive coding and visualization.

• Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

• NumPy: For numerical operations.

• Scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics.

• Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.

## Dataset

here i have used the "Mall customers Dataset," which includes various features in order to group and perform analysis . The dataset is available at Kaggle: Mall Customers Dataset.
